# Portfolio 📓
This project is a portfolio website using Flask. This will get you familiar with Python and some of the tools.

## Getting Started 🚀
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites 🔧
You need to have a web navigator, preferably the most updated versions:
> + Google Chrome
> + Firefox
> + Safari
> + Internet Explorer
> + Opera

### Installing ⚙️

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
 
Create a .env file using the example.env template

For Flask_Mail two variables will need to be set, EMAIL and EMAIL_PASSWORD. Currently Flask_Mail is configured to work with Gmail so a gmail account should be used. Otherwise, the Flask_Mail configuration settings can be changed in __init___.py 


Start flask development server
```bash
$ pip install Flask-Mail
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
